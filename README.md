# OCR
UWP OCR for AHK v2:
A wrapper for the the UWP Windows.Media.Ocr library. 
Introduced in Windows 10.0.10240.0, this OCR library is included with Windows, no special installs or executables required. Though it might be necessary to install language packs for the OCR, which requires admin access.

Special thanks to AHK forums user malcev, whose OCR function this library is based on.

Examples are included in the Examples folder.
